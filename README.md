## Environment Variables File
Database credentials are injected into the cloud.gov environments as part of the CI/CD deployment process therefore they do not need to be configured. However, when running locally for local development the following environment variables are required to be configured using a local .env file in the root of the project. **PLEASE DO NOT commit the .env file to source control.**

- EASEY_STREAMING SERVICES_ENABLE_DEBUG=true|false
- EASEY_STREAMING SERVICES_ENABLE_API_KEY=true|false
  - IF ABOVE IS TRUE THEN SET
    - EASEY_STREAMING SERVICES_API_KEY={ask project dev/tech lead}
- EASEY_STREAMING SERVICES_ENABLE_SECRET_TOKEN=true|false
  - IF ABOVE IS TRUE THEN SET
    - EASEY_STREAMING SERVICES_SECRET_TOKEN={ask project dev/tech lead}

**Please refer to our [Getting Started](https://github.com/US-EPA-CAMD/devops/blob/master/GETTING-STARTED.md) instructions on how to configure the following environment variables & connect to the database.**
- EASEY_DB_HOST
- EASEY_DB_PORT
- EASEY_DB_NAME
- EASEY_DB_USER
- EASEY_DB_PWD
